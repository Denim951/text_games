# Description
A Lightweight, terminal-based adventure game built in Python.
You explore mysterious rooms, uncover eerie clues, and face off against rival wizards in magical duels of strategy and chance.

## Gameplay

You’ll travel through a series of enchanted chambers — each guarded by a wizard.

The Red Wizard and Blue Wizard each have their own room, personality, and fighting style.

Combat is based on a spellcasting system inspired by rock–paper–scissors:

Each spell type can beat, lose to, or match another.

Choose wisely — your fate depends on it!

If you win, you advance deeper into the chambers.
If you lose, you are banished from the realm… until your next attempt.

## Features

Randomly generated mystery clues and sensory descriptions to create a fresh atmosphere each playthrough.

Modular encounter system that supports new enemies and rooms.

Simple command-line interface — no setup beyond Python required.

Built with clean, reusable classes for encounters, outcomes, and clue generation.
